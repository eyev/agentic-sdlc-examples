# Feature: Add Refresh Button to Users Table

## Feature Thesis

**Title:** User Table Manual Refresh

**Description:**  
Add a refresh button to the users management table that allows administrators to reload the latest data without refreshing the entire page. Currently, admins must reload the browser page to see updated user information, which loses their current scroll position, applied filters, and sort preferences. This feature will provide a single button that re-fetches data via API while preserving the current view state.

**Target Users:**
- System administrators
- Customer support staff
- User management team members

**Business Value:**  
Improves admin productivity by reducing friction in common workflows. Support staff frequently need to verify that account changes have been processed, and currently lose context when refreshing the page. Expected to reduce average task completion time by 15-20 seconds per user lookup operation.

## Technical Context

**Current State:**
- Users table displays data loaded on initial page load
- Data only updates when browser page is refreshed (F5)
- Page refresh loses: scroll position, active filters, sort order, selected rows
- Admins report frustration with context loss

**Desired State:**
- Refresh button in table toolbar
- Button triggers API call to re-fetch user data
- Preserves all current UI state (filters, sort, pagination, scroll)
- Visual feedback during refresh (loading spinner)
- Success/error notification

**Integration Points:**
- Existing `GET /api/users` endpoint
- Frontend state management (filters, sort, pagination)
- UI notification system

## Core Capabilities

### Primary Capabilities
1. **Refresh Button**
   - Icon button in table toolbar (circular arrow icon)
   - Tooltip: "Refresh user data"
   - Accessible via keyboard (focus state, Enter/Space to activate)
   - Disabled state during loading

2. **Data Refresh Logic**
   - Call existing `GET /api/users` with current query params
   - Maintain current filters, sort order, and pagination cursor
   - Update table rows with fresh data
   - Preserve scroll position if possible

3. **Loading State**
   - Spinning icon on refresh button during request
   - Optional: Semi-transparent overlay on table
   - Button disabled to prevent duplicate requests
   - Cancel in-flight request if new refresh triggered

4. **User Feedback**
   - Success: Brief "Data refreshed" toast notification
   - Error: "Failed to refresh data" with retry option
   - Show timestamp of last successful refresh
   - Optional: Auto-dismiss notification after 3 seconds

### Secondary Capabilities
- Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R) to trigger refresh
- Auto-refresh option (configurable interval)
- Show indicator if data is stale (>5 minutes old)

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Admin Verifying Account Update
1. Admin views users table
2. Makes a change to user account (different screen/tab)
3. Returns to users table
4. Clicks refresh button
5. Table updates with new data showing the change
6. Admin confirms update was successful

### Journey 2: Support Agent Checking Recent Signups
1. Support agent has users table open with filters applied
2. Customer reports not seeing their new account
3. Agent clicks refresh button
4. New users appear in table (filters still applied)
5. Agent locates customer's account
6. Provides confirmation to customer

### Journey 3: Error Handling
1. Admin clicks refresh button
2. Network request fails (timeout or server error)
3. Error notification appears
4. Admin clicks retry in notification
5. Request succeeds, table updates
6. Success notification appears

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative:**
- Page reload frequency decreases by 60%
- Task completion time improves by 15-20 seconds
- API response time for refresh: <500ms

**Qualitative:**
- Positive feedback from admin users
- Reduced complaints about losing filters/context
- Improved perceived application responsiveness

## Technical Specifications

**API Call:**
```javascript
// Reuse current query parameters
GET /api/users?
  filter=active&
  sort=created_desc&
  limit=20&
  cursor=eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ
```

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Use existing API client/fetch wrapper
- Preserve current state (filters, sort, pagination cursor)
- Update table data in state management store
- Handle loading and error states
- Maintain scroll position using DOM APIs

**UI Components:**
- Refresh button (icon button component)
- Loading spinner (existing component)
- Toast notification (existing notification system)
- Optional: Last updated timestamp display

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Refresh button visible in users table toolbar
- [ ] Button triggers API call with current query params
- [ ] Table data updates with response
- [ ] Current filters preserved after refresh
- [ ] Current sort order preserved after refresh
- [ ] Current pagination state preserved after refresh

### User Experience
- [ ] Loading spinner appears on button during request
- [ ] Button disabled during loading
- [ ] Success notification shows after refresh completes
- [ ] Error notification shows if request fails
- [ ] Scroll position maintained (or returns to top predictably)
- [ ] Keyboard accessible (focus state, Enter/Space activation)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Network errors show user-friendly message
- [ ] 5xx errors show retry option
- [ ] 4xx errors show appropriate message
- [ ] Request timeout handled gracefully (10s timeout)
- [ ] Duplicate clicks prevented during loading

### Performance
- [ ] Refresh completes in <500ms (typical case)
- [ ] No memory leaks from repeated refreshes
- [ ] Debouncing prevents excessive API calls
- [ ] Loading state appears within 100ms of click

## Dependencies

**Technical:**
- Existing `GET /api/users` endpoint
- Frontend state management (Redux/Context/etc.)
- Notification/toast system
- Icon library (refresh icon)

**Team:**
- Frontend engineer (0.5-1 sprint)
- QA engineer (testing various scenarios)
- UX designer (optional, for icon/placement review)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Race conditions (multiple rapid clicks) | Low | Debounce button, cancel previous request |
| Stale data still shown on error | Low | Keep existing data, show error notification |
| Performance with large datasets | Low | Same performance as initial load |
| Breaking existing filters | Medium | Thorough testing of state preservation |

## Future Enhancements

- Auto-refresh toggle with configurable interval (30s, 1m, 5m)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket (replace refresh button)
- Partial refresh (only changed rows)
- Show diff indicator for updated rows
- Undo functionality for accidental refreshes
- Optimistic updates for pending changes
