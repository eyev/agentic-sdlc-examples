# Feature Request: Customer Dashboard Improvements

## What We Need

We need a better dashboard for our customers. Right now customers are complaining that they can't see their stuff easily and it takes too long to find what they're looking for. The sales team is getting frustrated because customers keep calling support for basic things they should be able to see themselves.

## Why This Matters

- Customers are unhappy with current dashboard
- Support tickets are way up (like 30% more this quarter?)
- Sales team says they're losing deals because dashboard looks "outdated"
- Competitors have better dashboards apparently

## What Customers Are Asking For

From the feedback we've been getting:

1. Want to see their recent orders right away
2. Need to track shipments better - they keep asking "where's my stuff"
3. Want to see how much they've spent (finance team needs this too for some reason)
4. Something about notifications? Not sure exactly but they mentioned it
5. Mobile doesn't work great - lots of complaints there

## Current Problems

- Dashboard is slow (IT says something about the database?)
- Have to click around too much to find things
- Charts don't make sense
- Can't export reports (not sure if this is critical)
- Colors don't match our new branding

## Success

If customers stop calling support as much and sales team is happy, that would be great. Maybe we can measure satisfaction somehow? Also the CEO mentioned we should track usage.

## Technical Stuff

Not really sure about the technical requirements. The dev team will know what to do. We need it to work on phones and computers. Should be fast. Security is important (obviously).

Maybe we can use some of those fancy charts everyone talks about? And it should look modern.

## Timeline

Would be great to have this before the holiday season. Big customers are renewing contracts in Q4 so we really need this.

## Notes

- Marketing wants to add some promotional banners to the dashboard
- Finance needs access to customer spending data
- Legal mentioned something about privacy compliance but didn't give details
- IT said something about API limits?

Budget: TBD (probably need to discuss with finance)
