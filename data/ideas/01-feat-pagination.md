# Feature: Add Pagination to Products List

## Feature Thesis

**Title:** Product List Pagination

**Description:**  
Add server-side pagination to the products listing endpoint to improve performance and user experience. Currently, the `/products` endpoint returns all products in a single response, which causes slow load times and poor UX when the catalog grows beyond 100 items. This feature will implement cursor-based pagination with configurable page sizes.

**Target Users:**
- Frontend web application
- Mobile app developers
- Third-party API consumers
- Internal admin dashboard users

**Business Value:**  
Improves application performance and reduces server load as the product catalog scales. Enables better user experience with faster page loads and infinite scroll capabilities. Reduces bandwidth costs by limiting response payload sizes.

## Technical Context

**Current State:**
- `GET /products` returns entire product catalog (currently ~500 products)
- Average response time: 2.3 seconds
- Response payload: ~8MB
- No filtering or sorting applied

**Desired State:**
- Paginated responses with default 20 items per page
- Configurable page size (max 100 items)
- Response time target: <300ms
- Include pagination metadata in responses

**Integration Points:**
- Existing product service API
- Frontend product catalog pages
- Mobile app product browsing
- Admin product management interface

## Core Capabilities

### Primary Capabilities
1. **Cursor-Based Pagination**
   - Use cursor/token for next/previous page navigation
   - More efficient than offset-based for large datasets
   - Consistent results even when data changes

2. **Configurable Page Size**
   - Default: 20 items per page
   - Allow `limit` parameter (min: 1, max: 100)
   - Return actual page size in response metadata

3. **Pagination Metadata**
   - Total count of items (optional, configurable)
   - Current page info (cursor, size)
   - Navigation tokens (next_cursor, previous_cursor)
   - Boolean flags (has_next, has_previous)

### Secondary Capabilities
- Maintain existing query parameters (search, filters, sort)
- Backward compatibility with clients not using pagination
- Cache pagination results for common queries

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Frontend Developer Implementing Pagination
1. Developer updates API call to include `limit` parameter
2. Receives first page of 20 products
3. Extracts `next_cursor` from response metadata
4. Makes subsequent request with cursor parameter
5. Receives next page of products
6. Continues until `has_next` is false

### Journey 2: Mobile App Infinite Scroll
1. User opens product catalog screen
2. App loads first page (20 products)
3. User scrolls to bottom
4. App detects scroll and fetches next page using cursor
5. New products appended to list seamlessly
6. Process repeats as user continues scrolling

### Journey 3: Admin Bulk Operations
1. Admin accesses product management dashboard
2. Selects large page size (100 items) for efficiency
3. Performs bulk actions on current page
4. Navigates to next page using cursor
5. Continues bulk operations across pages

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative:**
- API response time: <300ms (p95)
- Payload size: <500KB per request
- Server memory usage: Reduced by 60%
- Database query time: <100ms
- Zero data inconsistencies in paginated results

**Qualitative:**
- Improved perceived performance by users
- Reduced bounce rate on product pages
- Positive developer feedback on API usability

## Technical Specifications

**API Changes:**

### Request Parameters
```
GET /products?limit=20&cursor=eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ&sort=created_desc
```

- `limit` (optional): Number of items per page (default: 20, max: 100)
- `cursor` (optional): Pagination cursor from previous response
- Existing params maintained: `search`, `category`, `sort`

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "prod_123",
      "name": "Product Name",
      "price": 29.99,
      ...
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 20,
    "count": 20,
    "has_next": true,
    "has_previous": false,
    "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI6MTQzfQ",
    "previous_cursor": null,
    "total_count": 487
  }
}
```

**Database Changes:**
- Add composite index on common sort fields
- Optimize query to use cursor-based WHERE clause
- Consider materialized view for expensive filters

**Backward Compatibility:**
- If no pagination params provided, return first page with default limit
- Include deprecation warning header for non-paginated usage

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] GET /products supports `limit` parameter (1-100)
- [ ] GET /products supports `cursor` parameter
- [ ] Response includes pagination metadata object
- [ ] Cursor tokens are opaque and secure
- [ ] Results are consistent across page boundaries

### Performance
- [ ] Response time <300ms for paginated requests
- [ ] Response payload <500KB per page
- [ ] Database queries use appropriate indexes
- [ ] Cursor generation/parsing adds <10ms overhead

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty result set returns valid pagination structure
- [ ] Invalid cursor returns 400 error with clear message
- [ ] Limit exceeding max (100) returns 400 error
- [ ] Expired/stale cursors handled gracefully
- [ ] Last page correctly indicates has_next=false

### Compatibility
- [ ] Existing query parameters work with pagination
- [ ] Non-paginated requests still work (with warning)
- [ ] API documentation updated with examples
- [ ] Client SDK updated with pagination helpers

## Dependencies

**Technical:**
- Database index creation (minimal downtime)
- API version update (backward compatible)
- Response schema validation updates

**Team:**
- Backend engineer (1 sprint)
- QA engineer (testing, performance validation)
- Technical writer (API docs update)
- Frontend engineer (optional, for implementation guidance)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking change for existing clients | Medium | Maintain backward compatibility, deprecation period |
| Cursor token security | Low | Encrypt/sign cursors, validate on server |
| Performance regression | Medium | Thorough load testing, database query optimization |
| Inconsistent results during data changes | Low | Document cursor behavior, consider stable sort keys |

## Future Enhancements

- Offset-based pagination option (for random access)
- GraphQL pagination support (Relay-style connections)
- Pagination for related resources (product variants, reviews)
- Page number-based navigation (for traditional UIs)
- Bulk export endpoint (bypass pagination for reports)
