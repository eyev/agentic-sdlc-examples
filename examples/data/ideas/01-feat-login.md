# Feature: User Authentication & Login System

## Feature Thesis

**Title:** Secure Multi-Factor Authentication Login System

**Description:**  
Implement a comprehensive authentication system that supports traditional email/password login with optional multi-factor authentication (MFA). The system should provide secure session management, password recovery, and account lockout protection against brute force attacks. This feature serves as the foundational security layer for the entire platform, enabling user identity verification and access control.

**Target Users:**
- End users (customers) accessing the platform
- Enterprise customers requiring SSO integration
- System administrators managing user access
- Mobile and web application clients
- Third-party API consumers

**Business Value:**  
Establishes trust and security as foundational platform capabilities, enabling enterprise customer acquisition and meeting compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR). Reduces support overhead through self-service password recovery and provides foundation for personalized user experiences. Expected to unlock $2M in enterprise contracts requiring SSO/MFA capabilities.

## Technical Context

**System Architecture:**
- RESTful API with JWT-based authentication
- Microservices architecture with dedicated auth service
- PostgreSQL for user credentials and session storage
- Redis for rate limiting and session caching
- Integration with email service for verification and recovery

**Integration Points:**
- User profile service (downstream consumer)
- Email notification service
- Audit logging service
- Optional: OAuth2 providers (Google, Microsoft, GitHub)
- Optional: SAML/SSO gateway for enterprise customers

   - Duplicate account prevention

2. **Secure Login**
   - Email/password authentication
   - JWT token issuance (access + refresh tokens)
   - Session management with configurable TTL
   - Device/browser tracking

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - TOTP-based MFA (authenticator apps)
   - SMS-based MFA (optional, with rate limiting)
   - Backup codes for account recovery
   - MFA enforcement policies

4. **Password Management**
   - Self-service password reset via email
   - Password change for authenticated users
   - Password history tracking (prevent reuse)
   - Configurable password policies

5. **Security Measures**
   - Account lockout after failed attempts
   - Rate limiting on all auth endpoints
   - Session invalidation/logout
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Audit trail for all auth events

### Secondary Capabilities
- Remember me functionality (extended sessions)
- Social login integration (OAuth2)
- Enterprise SSO/SAML support
- User consent management
- Session device management (view/revoke)

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: New User Onboarding
1. User navigates to registration page
2. Submits email and password
3. Receives verification email
4. Clicks verification link
5. Account activated, redirected to login
6. (Optional) Prompted to set up MFA
7. Successfully logged in

### Journey 2: Returning User Login
1. User navigates to login page
2. Enters email and password
3. (If MFA enabled) Prompted for MFA code
4. Enters MFA code from authenticator app
5. Receives access token
6. Accesses protected resources

### Journey 3: Password Recovery
1. User clicks "Forgot Password"
2. Enters email address
3. Receives password reset email
4. Clicks reset link (time-limited)
5. Sets new password
6. Automatically logged in or redirected to login

### Journey 4: API Integration
1. Third-party developer registers API credentials
2. Obtains client ID and secret
3. Exchanges credentials for access token
4. Uses token to call protected API endpoints
5. Refreshes token when expired

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative:**
- Login success rate > 98%
- MFA adoption rate > 30% within 3 months
- Password reset completion rate > 85%
- Token refresh success rate > 99.5%
- API response time (p95) < 200ms for auth endpoints
- Zero unauthorized access incidents

**Qualitative:**
- User feedback on login friction
- Customer support ticket reduction for auth issues
- Enterprise customer satisfaction with SSO
- Developer satisfaction with API auth docs

## Technical Specifications

**API Contract Reference:** `examples/agents/sample_contracts/auth_api.yaml`

**Key Endpoints:**
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/verify-email` - Email verification
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate user
- `POST /auth/mfa/verify` - MFA code verification
- `POST /auth/mfa/setup` - Enable MFA for account
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `POST /auth/logout` - Invalidate session
- `POST /auth/password/reset-request` - Request password reset
- `POST /auth/password/reset` - Complete password reset
- `PATCH /auth/password/change` - Change password (authenticated)
- `GET /auth/sessions` - List active sessions
- `DELETE /auth/sessions/{id}` - Revoke specific session

**Security Requirements:**
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- JWT tokens signed with RS256 (asymmetric keys)
- Access tokens expire in 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens expire in 7 days
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (15 min cooldown)
- Rate limiting: 10 requests/minute per IP for auth endpoints
- TLS 1.3 required for all auth endpoints
- CORS configured for allowed origins only
